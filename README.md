# Real-Time Attendance System

This repository contains the **Real-Time Attendance System** developed as a
semester project for the **Validation and Testing** course.

The project focuses on building a well-documented software system by applying
software engineering principles, validation techniques, and systematic testing
approaches.

---

## Project Description
The Real-Time Attendance System is designed to track and manage attendance data
in real time. The system aims to provide a reliable and scalable solution by
clearly defining system requirements, designing structured models, and
supporting them with detailed documentation and interface designs.

## System Analysis and Design

### Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams were created to identify system actors and define their
interactions with the system. These diagrams help clarify functional
requirements and user responsibilities within the system.

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams
ER diagrams were designed to model the system database structure. They define
entities, attributes, and relationships required to store and manage attendance
data efficiently.

### Additional Diagrams
Various system diagrams such as:
- sequence diagrams,
- activity diagrams,
- flow diagrams  

were prepared to represent system behavior and data flow.

---

## User Interface Design
The user interface designs were created using **Figma**. These designs represent
the visual layout and user experience of the system, including:
- login screens,
- attendance views,
- management panels.

All UI design files and exported visuals are stored under the
`docs/user_interface_design/` directory.

---

## Validation and Testing Focus
As part of the Validation and Testing course requirements:
- system requirements were analyzed and validated,
- design artifacts were reviewed for consistency,
- documentation was prepared to support testing activities.

The project emphasizes traceability between requirements, design, and testing
artifacts.
